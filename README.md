# accessibiLint

AccessibiLint is a tool that help Android developers to check their app accessibility during the code phase. The tool was build using the Android Lint and is a library for Android Studio that notify the developer when some part of the Android app could cause accessibility issues for visually impaired people.

Currently, the AccessibiLint tool checks for 17 issues that was collected using the following acessibiLint guidelines: WCAG 2.0, BBC Accessibility Guidelines, SIDI accessibility guidelines and the recomendations from Gomes (2018) and Martins (2015) master dissertations.

This tool was a result of my master dissertation that aims to help Android developer create more accessible apps.
